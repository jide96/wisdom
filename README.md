# WISDOM

A simple BASH script that displays some helpful advice for software developers. It is essentially a "Hello World" program that is hopefully more useful.

This is something I created as a kind of checklist for development projects. I am also using this as a simple test project for learning to use GitHub.

Written and tested on Linux. Not tested elsewhere.
